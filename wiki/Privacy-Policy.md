# TimeOwl Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 13, 2026

**TimeOwl** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our servers.**

### Local Data Storage
TimeOwl operates on a "Privacy-First" principle. All data generated by the extension is stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This includes:
- Websites you visit (for time tracking purposes).
- Time spent on each website.
- Your settings and preferences.

This data never leaves your browser unless you explicitly choose to export it (feature coming soon) or use optional AI features.

### AI Features (Optional)
If you choose to use the AI Insights feature:
- You must provide your own API Key (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key).
- We send a summarized version of your browsing data (e.g., "Top 5 sites visited today and their duration") to the AI provider you selected (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek).
- This data is sent **only** for the purpose of generating the insight report for you.
- We do not store your API Key or the data sent/received on any of our servers. Your API Key is stored locally in your browser.

## 2. Third-Party Services
TimeOwl may interact with third-party AI providers **only if you configure them**. Please refer to their respective privacy policies:
- OpenAI: [https://openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- DeepSeek: [https://www.deepseek.com/privacy](https://www.deepseek.com/privacy)
- (And other providers you may configure)

## 3. Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your local machine and browser. We recommend keeping your browser and operating system updated.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
